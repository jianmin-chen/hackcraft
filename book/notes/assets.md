These assets on website require drawing:

* Hackcraft logo
* JC Nerds Out: Itsa me but in cartoon form! I want something like [this](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2190y8/styles/profileIcon_i0z5u9xln96b1.png?width=256&height=256&frame=1&auto=webp&crop=256:256,smart&s=6d616cec6860a859dea88a4b9fe8bc02337faee1)
* GLs all the way down

Perhaps without drawing:

* Graphics pipeline
* How VAOs, VBOs relate
* Yaw, pitch as right triangles

Interactives I have gathered:

* Triangle being rasterized
* Interleaved buffer
* Euler angles on a plane
* Yaw and pitch together with rotate -> a pyramid with the camera pointing towards the target
