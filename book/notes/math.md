Before we get started I want to talk a little bit about math. Most people think they're bad at math, including me. But I think most of us are just [lacking the prerequisites]().

Plus, I threw in a lot of interactive graphics so even if you despise math, I implore you to give this a go! I had to brush on everything here too before I got the hang of what the #$%* was going on. If I'm rusty and I can get it you can too. 

## Vectors and matrices

First let's talk about some fundamental data types that we're going to use: vectors and matrices.

**Vectors** are basically arrays that can hold three numbers.

**Matrices** are basically

## A little bit of trig

Armed with these two things we are probably ready to look at some tangible concepts and applications.

## Projection

I want us to think about the camera for a moment.
