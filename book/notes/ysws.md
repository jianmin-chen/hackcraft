You merge a pull request that makes a significant improvement to Hackcraft

* Maps
* Redstone
* Animations for destroying blocks. Most blocks also come with a particle effect where minature clones of the blocks "spray" out when you destroy it. This may require taking a look into animating particle systems.
* Improved movement system. Minecraft has a couple of quality-of-life improvements for the movement, including ease-out functions to "slow to a stop".
* More terrain generation. Cliffs, overhangs, stars/planets in the sky... I think this is one of those where the sky is your imagination.
* Improved text rendering. Right now, we don't have support for emojis
