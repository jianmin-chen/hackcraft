So up until this point we've been pretty happy with a rotating cube.

So the player has an actual position, and a camera or "eyes" attached to its head if you will. The camera is always going to x amount taller than the position because this intuitively makes sense.

The target of the camera will always be in front of the player.

When we move the player, the position changes, and everything gets adjusted by the position.
