Please check out all these good resources. Poring over them helped me write this book.

* [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) and associated, like
* Math
  * [songho.ca]().
* Shaders
  * [Inigo Quilez](). This man is the GOAT. Watch him on Youtube
  * [The Book of Shaders](). Unfortunately incomplete. Has good [reference]() page
  * [Shadertoy](). This is like code golf but for graphics programming. 
* Voxel engines
  * [0fps.net](). More technical explanations

> Shadertoy is essentially a programming language that compiles down to your operating system's preferred shader language, e.g. OpenGL ES or Metal appear to be the most common ones. I really want to write a little compiler for Shadertoy to explore PL (programming language) design. That would be really cool.

The best thing to do is to Google. There's so much on graphics programming that there's a whole conference dedicated to it. And despite what people say, Wikipedia is a good resource and not that hard to understand.

Many of the chapters included a extra resources section at the bottom, so feel free to go back and read those!
