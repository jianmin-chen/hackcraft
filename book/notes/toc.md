## Introduction

## Part I

* UI rendering

## Part II

* Jazzing up the UI, part I: text rendering
  * We can finally take a look at how to show debug info.
* Jazzing up the UI, part II: buttons, hotbars, inventory
* Multiplayer server
* YSWS: Write your own

## Conclusion

## Appendices

* Appendice A: Nerding out
